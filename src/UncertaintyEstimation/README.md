Full version will be available once this work was accepted for publish.

## step by step:
1. Download/collect CT data and corresponding GTV contour.
2. Data preprocessing and feature extraction.
3. Feature pre-selection, delta-radiomics feature calculation.
4. Radiomics model construction.
5. Epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty estimation.
6. Sample rejection and model performance re-evaluation.
